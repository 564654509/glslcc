## glslcc: Cross-compiler for GLSL shader language (GLSL->HLSL,METAL,GLES)
[@septag](https://twitter.com/septagh)

**glslcc** is a command line tool that converts GLSL (version 4.5) code to HLSL, GLES (version 2.0 and 3.0) and Metal (MSL).  
It uses [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) for parsing and [SPIRV-cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross) for converting the code from SPIR-V to the target language.  

### Features

- Currently, vertex, fragment and compute shaders are supported
- Flatten UBOs, useful for ES2 shaders
- Show preprocessor result
- Add defines
- Add include directories
- shader reflection data in Json format
- Can output to a native binary file format (.sgs), that holds all the shaders and reflection data for pipeline
- Can output to individual files
- Can output all pipeline shaders (vertex+fragment) and their reflection data to .c file variables
- Supports both GLES2 and GLES3 shaders

### Build
_glslcc_ uses CMake. Currently tested with Visual Studio 2015.  
The code is portable and other platforms should be built without errors, although I have to test and confirm this.

### Usage

I'll have to write a more detailed documentation but for now checkout ```glslcc --help``` for command line options.  

Here's some examples:  

Example shader (write shaders GLSL 4.5) : 
You can also use ```#include```. The compiler automatically inserts ```#extension GL_GOOGLE_include_directive : require``` at the begining of any shader.  

Vertex Shader (shader.vert):

```glsl
#version 450

layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;
layout (location = 1) in vec4 aColor;
layout (location = 2) in vec2 aCoord;

layout (std140) uniform matrices
{
    mat4 projection;
    mat4 view;
    mat4 model;
};

layout (location = 0) out flat vec4 outColor;
layout (location = 1) out vec2 outCoord;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = projection * view * model * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
    outColor = aColor;
    outCoord = aCoord;
}  

```

Fragment shader (shader.frag): 

```glsl
#version 450

precision mediump float;

layout (location = 0) in flat vec4 inColor;
layout (location = 1) in vec2 inCoord;

layout (location = 0) out vec4 fragColor;

layout (binding = 0) uniform sampler2D colorMap;

void main() 
{
    lowp vec4 c = texture(colorMap, inCoord);
    fragColor = inColor * c;
}
```

Cross-compiles the vertex-shader and fragment-shader to HLSL files with reflection Json data
Output files will be _shader_vs.hlsl_, _shader_fs.hlsl_ for HLSL code, and _shader_vs.hlsl.json_, _shader_fs.hlsl.json_ for their reflection data.


```
glslcc --vert=shader.vert --frag=shader.frag --output=shader.hlsl --lang=hlsl --reflect
```

This command does the same thing, but outputs all the data to a C header file *shader.h*, with specified variable names *g_shader_vs*, *g_shader_fs*, *g_shader_vs_refl* and *g_shader_fs_refl* which are the same data in files in hex representation.

```
glslcc --vert=shader.vert --frag=shader.frag --output=shader.h --lang=hlsl --reflect --cvar=g_shader
```

### TODO

- More documentation
- Support for offline compiling of HLSL files (D3DCompiler)
- LZ4 compression for SGS binary files
- Support for more shader stages. I didn't have any use for geometry and tesselation shaders, but the _glslang_ supports all of them, so adding new shader stages shouldn't be a problem
